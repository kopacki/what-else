# what-else

Let's start with something easy and simple. What about writing an own blog platform using these extremely glossy and shiny web technologies?

Features:
* let's have some content presented as a list of posts (yeah, mock them all for now 😎)
* almost forgot, try to go with TDD 🤖

Tech stack:
* React 💪🏻 (it had to be easy and simple, remember?)
* Next.js 🔝 (let's check if we can deliver react-based components directly from server)

That's it for now! In small setps 🚶🏻
